# Vexorbis Swarm Implementation Status

> [!NOTE]
> This document tracks the implementation maturity of Swarm components. It serves as a source of truth for developers to know what is production-ready and what is still in the "stub/skeleton" phase.

**Last Updated:** 2026-01-21

## ✅ Production Ready (Stable)

These components are fully implemented, tested, and considered stable for production use.

### Core Infrastructure
- **LLM Router (`mcp_core/llm.py`)**: Robust implementation with Gemini cascading fallbacks, OpenAI support, and Local (Ollama) integration. ([#10](https://github.com/projectvgony/Vexorbis/issues/10))
- **FastMCP Server (`server.py`)**: Fully functional MCP protocol implementation. ([#8](https://github.com/projectvgony/Vexorbis/issues/8))
- **Logging & Telemetry**: Comprehensive logging and event tracking. ([#20](https://github.com/projectvgony/Vexorbis/issues/20))

### Algorithm Workers
- **HippoRAG Retriever (`mcp_core/algorithms/hipporag_retriever.py`)**: 
    - Full AST graph construction.
    - Personalized PageRank implementation.
    - Support for Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, and Rust.
- **Ochiai Fault Localizer (`mcp_core/algorithms/ochiai_localizer.py`)**: ([#12](https://github.com/projectvgony/Vexorbis/issues/12))
    - Full statistical debugging using `coverage.py`.
    - Spectrum-based fault localization logic complete.
- **Language Parsers (`mcp_core/algorithms/parsers/`)**:
    - `PythonParser`: Uses built-in `ast`.
    - `TreeSitterParser`: Base class for tree-sitter based parsers.
    - `GoParser`, `RustParser`, `JavaScriptParser`, `TypeScriptParser`: Fully implemented.

### Local Tools
- **Git Worker (`mcp_core/algorithms/git_worker.py`)**: ([#8](https://github.com/projectvgony/Vexorbis/issues/8))
    - Repository detection (Git, GitHub, GitLab).
    - Workflow instruction generation.

---

## ⚠️ Partial Implementation (Core Only)

These components have a solid foundation but lack high-level abstractions or convenience wrappers.

- **Z3 Verifier (`mcp_core/algorithms/z3_verifier.py`)**: 
    - **Done**: Low-level SMT solver integration, symbolic variable creation, basic verification logic.
    - **Missing**: High-level code-to-logic generators (automated translation of Python code to Z3 constraints).

---

## 🚧 Experimental / Skeleton (Active Development)

These components have high-level classes and methods defined to establish the architecture, but the internal logic is currently stubbed with placeholders.

### Autonomous Git Engine (`mcp_core/algorithms/git_roles/`) ([#19](https://github.com/projectvgony/Vexorbis/issues/19) / [#25](https://github.com/projectvgony/Vexorbis/issues/25))
- **`FeatureScout`**: `✅ Functional` - Scans for TODOs, identifies underdeveloped modules via HippoRAG, generates LLM-powered proposals, creates issues.
- **`CodeAuditor`**: `✅ Functional` - Security pattern scanning, git diff integration, markdown report generation, telemetry provenance.
- **`IssueTriage`**: `✅ Functional` - Priority matrix (P0-P3), impact/effort estimation, label suggestions, memory store integration.
- **`BranchManager`**: `✅ Functional` - PR merge verification, stacked PR tracking, PLAN.md updates, branch pruning.
- **`ProjectLifecycle`**: `✅ Functional` - Project bootstrap, progress updates, archival, template loading, initial task generation.

### Dynamic Tools
- **Deliberation (`mcp_core/tools/dynamic/deliberation.py`)**:
    - **Current**: Implements structured `Decompose` → `Analyze` → `Synthesize` workflow. Uses `HippoRAG` for context and simulates workers via LLM.

## 🔜 Roadmap (Planned)

Features planned for future phases but not yet present in the codebase.

- **Phase 5**:
    - Collaborative Swarm (Swarm-to-Swarm communication protocol).
    - Neural Bug Detection (ML models trained on provenance logs).
    - Java Language Support.
